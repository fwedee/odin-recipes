      The Margherita pizza is a timeless classic that showcases the simplicity

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="list_center">
      <li>1 ball of pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
      <li>1 cup of tomato sauce</li>
      <li>200g fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="list_center">
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat the Oven: </strong> Preheat your oven to its highest
        setting, usually around 250°C (482°F). If you have a pizza stone, place
        it in the oven to heat up.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Dough: </strong>On a lightly floured surface,
        stretch the pizza dough into a thin, round shape. Transfer the dough to
        a piece of parchment paper for easy handling.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the Sauce: </strong>Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over
        the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the Cheese: </strong> Arrange the slices of fresh mozzarella
        evenly over the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the Pizza: </strong>Carefully transfer the pizza (with the
        parchment paper) onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake
        for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is
        bubbly and slightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the Basil: </strong>Remove the pizza from the oven and
        immediately scatter fresh basil leaves over the top. Drizzle with a
        little extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve: </strong>Slice and serve your Margherita pizza hot,
        enjoying the simple yet delicious combination of flavors.
      </li>
