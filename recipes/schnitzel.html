    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 veal cutlets (about 150g each)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (preferably fresh)</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil or clarified butter (for frying)</li>
      <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Prepare the Cutlets:</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place each veal cutlet between two sheets of plastic wrap or parchment
          paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently pound the cutlets with a meat mallet until they are about 1/4
          inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>Season both sides of the cutlets with salt and pepper.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Set Up Breading Station:</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the flour in a shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs in another shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Place the breadcrumbs in a third shallow dish.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Bread the Cutlets:</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Dredge each cutlet in the flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>Dip the cutlet into the beaten eggs, ensuring it is fully coated.</li>
        <li>Press the cutlet into the breadcrumbs, making sure it is evenly coated. Do not press the breadcrumbs into the meat too firmly.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Fry the Schnitzels:</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil or clarified butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot (but not smoking), add the breaded cutlets. Fry them in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook each cutlet for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked schnitzels to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Serve the Wiener Schnitzel hot with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
        <li>Traditional accompaniments include potato salad, cucumber salad, or fries.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
