      <li>2 large eggs</li>

      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat the Oven: </strong> Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F).
        Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cream the Butter and Sugars: </strong>In a large bowl, cream
        together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and
        fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the Eggs and Vanilla: </strong>Beat in the eggs one at a
        time, then stir in the vanilla extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine Dry Ingredients: </strong>In a separate bowl, whisk
        together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Gradually blend
        this into the butter mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the Chocolate Chips: </strong>Fold in the chocolate chips
        until evenly distributed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shape the Cookies: </strong>Drop rounded spoonfuls of dough onto
        the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake: </strong> Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are
        set but the centers are still soft. Allow the cookies to cool on the
        baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to
        cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve: </strong>Enjoy these chocolate cookies with a cold glass
        of milk or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra treat.
      </li>
