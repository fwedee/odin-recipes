# odin-recipes

*This is the first "project task" of the odinprojects foundations course.*

This project will be a collection of different recipes in pure Html. The HTML Pages include the recipes, a picture of the food and a short description how to do the food. It also includes a homepage from where you can access all of the recipes.

Side-Note: It will use a minimal amount of CSS.
